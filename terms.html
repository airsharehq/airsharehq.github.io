<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the AirShare application, website and related services (collectively, “Services”). By installing or using AirShare you agree to these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. Who we are</h2>
<p>“AirShare”, “we”, “us” or “our” refers to the AirShare project published at <a href="https://airsharehq.github.io">airsharehq.github.io</a>. Contact: <a href="mailto:info@trayairshare.com">info@trayairshare.com</a>.</p>

<h2>2. License & ownership</h2>
<p>Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the AirShare software on devices you own or control. We (and/or our licensors) retain all rights, title and interest in the software and the content on our site.</p>

<h3>2.1 License types</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Free License</strong>: limited functionality, free of charge.</li>
  <li><strong>Pro License (One-Time, 1-Year)</strong>: a one-time payment grants access to Pro features for 12 months from the purchase (transaction) date. After expiry, the Software reverts to Free mode unless you purchase a new 1-Year license.</li>
  <li><strong>Pro License (Lifetime)</strong>: a one-time payment grants access to Pro features for the lifetime of the product. “Lifetime” refers to the duration during which we continue to develop, distribute, and support the Software as a product. See Section 12.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You will not use the Services to infringe intellectual property rights or violate applicable law.</li>
  <li>You will not reverse engineer, decompile or attempt to access source code except where permitted by law.</li>
  <li>You will not use the Services to transmit malware, spam, or harmful content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Payments</h2>
<p>Payments are processed by <strong>Lemon Squeezy</strong> (our authorized reseller and Merchant of Record). Pricing and available license types are listed on the site and may change prospectively. Taxes may apply as determined by Lemon Squeezy. One-time licenses do <em>not</em> auto-renew. If we ever offer subscriptions in the future, they would renew until canceled via Lemon Squeezy’s customer portal.</p>

<h2>5. Peer-to-peer & relays</h2>
<p>AirShare primarily operates over your local network using peer-to-peer connections. Optional encrypted relay services may be used to connect devices outside your LAN. You are responsible for the content you transfer.</p>

<h2>6. Third-party services</h2>
<p>AirShare may rely on third-party services (e.g., GitHub Releases for downloads, Lemon Squeezy for billing). Their terms and privacy practices apply when you interact with them.</p>

<h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
<p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

<h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, or revenues, arising out of or related to your use of the Services.</p>

<h2>9. Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your access if you materially breach these Terms. You may stop using the Services at any time. Upon termination, the license granted to you ends.</p>

<h2>10. Changes</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes apply prospectively. We will indicate the “Last updated” date below and, where appropriate, provide additional notice.</p>

<h2>11. Governing law</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise required by mandatory local law, these Terms are governed by the laws of Croatia, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles, and courts in Zagreb, Croatia shall have jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>12. Lifetime license — product lifetime & discontinuation</h2>
<p>A Lifetime license grants the right to use Pro features without recurring fees for the <em>lifetime of the product</em>. “Lifetime” refers to the period during which AirShare is offered, maintained, or supported by us. We may, at our sole discretion, modify, deprecate, or discontinue the Software at any time. In such case, previously delivered versions may continue to operate on supported platforms, but no further updates, fixes, compatibility patches or support are guaranteed.</p>

<h2>13. One-time 1-Year license — expiry</h2>
<p>The 1-Year license is valid for 12 months from the original transaction date (plus any grace period we may announce). After expiry, Pro features are disabled unless you purchase a new 1-Year license. We are not obligated to provide upgrades, maintenance, or compatibility updates beyond the license period.</p>

<h2>14. Refunds</h2>
<p><strong>No refunds.</strong> All sales are final. We do not offer refunds for one-time or lifetime licenses, except where required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>15. No future compatibility guarantee</h2>
<p>We do not guarantee that the Software will remain compatible with future OS versions, hardware, or platform changes. This applies to both 1-Year and Lifetime licenses.</p>

<h2>16. Contact</h2>
<p>For questions about these Terms or licensing, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@trayairshare.com">info@trayairshare.com</a>.</p>
